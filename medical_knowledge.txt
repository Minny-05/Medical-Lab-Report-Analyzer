Hemoglobin:
Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.
Low hemoglobin levels may indicate anemia, blood loss, nutritional deficiency, or chronic disease.
Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, and shortness of breath.
High hemoglobin may occur due to dehydration, smoking, lung disease, or living at high altitude.


RBC:
Red Blood Cells (RBC) carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues.
Low RBC count may suggest anemia or blood loss.
High RBC count may be seen in dehydration or certain bone marrow conditions.


Total Leukocyte Count:
Total Leukocyte Count measures the total number of white blood cells in blood.
High levels may indicate infection, inflammation, or immune response.
Low levels may increase susceptibility to infections.


WBC:
White Blood Cells (WBC) help the body fight infections.
Elevated WBC levels often occur during infections or inflammation.
Low WBC levels may be due to bone marrow issues or certain viral illnesses.


Platelet Count:
Platelets help in blood clotting and prevent excessive bleeding.
Low platelet levels may increase bleeding risk.
High platelet levels may increase clot formation risk.


Hematocrit:
Hematocrit measures the percentage of red blood cells in blood.
Low hematocrit may indicate anemia.
High hematocrit may occur in dehydration or certain blood disorders.


PCV:
Packed Cell Volume (PCV) represents the proportion of blood made up of red cells.
Abnormal values may suggest anemia or dehydration.


MCV:
Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) measures the average size of red blood cells.
Low MCV may indicate iron deficiency anemia.
High MCV may suggest vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.


MCH:
Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) measures the amount of hemoglobin per red cell.
Abnormal values may indicate different types of anemia.


MCHC:
Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) measures hemoglobin concentration in red cells.
Low levels may indicate iron deficiency.
High levels are less common but may be linked to certain red cell disorders.


RDW:
Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) measures variation in red blood cell size.
High RDW may indicate mixed types of anemia.


Neutrophils:
Neutrophils are white blood cells that fight bacterial infections.
High neutrophil count may indicate bacterial infection or inflammation.
Low levels may increase infection risk.


Lymphocyte:
Lymphocytes help fight viral infections and regulate immunity.
High levels may indicate viral infections.
Low levels may occur during stress or immune suppression.


Monocytes:
Monocytes help remove dead cells and fight infection.
High levels may occur during chronic infections or inflammation.
Low levels are usually not clinically significant.


Eosinophils:
Eosinophils are involved in allergic reactions and parasitic infections.
High levels may indicate allergies or parasitic infection.


Basophils:
Basophils participate in immune responses and allergic reactions.
Elevated basophils may be linked to inflammatory or allergic conditions.


Blood Sugar:
Blood sugar (glucose) provides energy to body cells.
High levels may suggest diabetes or stress response.
Low levels may cause dizziness, weakness, or confusion.


Fasting Blood Sugar:
Fasting blood sugar measures glucose after overnight fasting.
Elevated levels may indicate impaired glucose control.


Postprandial Blood Sugar:
Postprandial blood sugar measures glucose after meals.
High levels may suggest poor blood sugar regulation.


Cholesterol:
Cholesterol is a fatty substance essential for cell structure.
High cholesterol increases risk of heart disease and stroke.


HDL:
HDL is called “good cholesterol.”
Higher HDL helps protect against heart disease.


LDL:
LDL is known as “bad cholesterol.”
High LDL increases risk of artery blockage.


Triglycerides:
Triglycerides are fats stored in the body.
High levels increase cardiovascular risk.


Creatinine:
Creatinine is a waste product filtered by kidneys.
High levels may indicate reduced kidney function.


Urea:
Urea is a byproduct of protein metabolism.
High levels may suggest kidney dysfunction or dehydration.


Sodium:
Sodium helps regulate fluid balance and nerve function.
High or low sodium levels may affect brain and muscle function.


Potassium:
Potassium regulates heart and muscle function.
Abnormal potassium levels may affect heart rhythm.


Calcium:
Calcium is important for bones, muscles, and nerve function.
Abnormal levels may affect bone strength or muscle activity.


Vitamin D:
Vitamin D supports bone health and immune function.
Low levels may weaken bones.
High levels may cause calcium imbalance.
